**Date**: 2025-12-29

This document consolidates research and key technical decisions for this module.

## Research Summary

No specific research was required for this module as the core technologies (ROS 2, URDF, Docusaurus) are well-defined industry standards and the `spec.md` provided sufficient detail for the conceptual nature of this educational module. The plan relies on established best practices for these technologies.
