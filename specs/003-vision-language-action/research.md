**Date**: 2025-12-30

This document consolidates research and key technical decisions for this module.

## Research Summary

No specific research was required for this module as the core technologies and concepts (Vision-Language-Action models, Large Language Models, ROS 2) are well-defined in the context of this conceptual educational module. The `spec.md` provides sufficient detail, and the plan relies on established best practices for explaining these architectures.
